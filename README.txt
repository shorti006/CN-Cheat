CN-Cheat
========

Status: Finished

My cheat engine;

Main Completed: Hook, shell menu, writing 32, 16, 8 bit codes, multiple codes, D type jokers, Inputing codes from .bin
Main Unfinished: E type jokers

UPDATE: No longer working on this. NetCheat has surpassed it and therefore will be the main goal.

NetCheat: (www.GitHub.com/Dnawrkshp/NetCheat/).
NetCheat Manager: (www.GitHub.com/Dnawrkshp/NetworkClient/).

If I find any bugs in the engine from NetCheat (since they  use the same engine), then I will update CN-Cheat as well.

Currently a working progress. Main reason to create my own is to add features that I have always wanted.
That other cheat device makers didn't want to implement or didn't want at all.
Also, most homebrew cheat devices are left unfinished. So I plan to complete a big task and implement the important
features first, before I stop.
Hopefully this will help me be more familiar with C and MIPS Assembly.
