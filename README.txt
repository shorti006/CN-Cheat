CN-Cheat
========

Status: Unfinished

My cheat engine;

Main Completed: Hook, shell menu, writing 32-bit codes
Main Unfinished: Inputing codes, 8, 16, and Joker writes

Currently a working progress. Main reason to create my own is to add features that I have always wanted.
That other cheat device makers didn't want to implement or didn't want at all.
Also, most homebrew cheat devices are left unfinished. So I plan to complete a big task and implement the important
features first, before I stop.
Hopefully this will help me be more familiar with C and MIPS Assembly.

School will be starting soon, which will be a huge drawback in my time being spent on this device.
